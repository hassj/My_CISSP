## I. Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability
CIA Triad, IAAA, Non-Repudiation
### CIA Triad
- Confidentiality: keeping information or communication private
- Integrity: Keeping information accurate and unmodified 
- Availability: Keeping resource and information accessible by authorized parties. 

> # How to support CIA triad
> Confidentiality: Encrypted the information
> 
> Integrity: Hashing support the Integrity by checking the information has been modified
> 
> Availability: Redundancy make sure the availability for any destruction

### IAAA (I Quarter A concept)
- Identification

Process of providing the claim of identity

- Authorization

Process of ensuring that an identity allowed to access the requested resource or activity

- Authentication

Process of verifying that an identity is truly what its claim to be.

- Auditing

process of tracking the action of identity

- Accountability 

that is the process of holding people responsible for their action

- Non-repudiation

Using mechanism digital signature Prevent individual from disputing their action.

## II. Governance and Compliance
Aligning security function, Plan types, Organization process, Due care and due  diligence, Roles and Responsibilities, Frameworks, Compliance
### Different between Governance and compliance
- Governance deal with developing an approach or method for implementing the security in your ORG through policies, procedure.
- Compliance focus on the meeting a requirement set by another identity.
### Aligning security function
we have 4 concepts: 

- Objective: small achievement toward the ORG goal
- Goal: Accomplishment that ORG seeks to achieve by a set time 
- Mission: consist of value, cultures, and vision
- Strategy: the way define how the ORG accomplish mission, goal and exist

### Plan types
- Operational plan

Short term plan that ensure the ORG operate

Time: daily, month, quarterly

- Tactical plan

Annual goals that ORG seeks to reach

Time: annually

- Strategic plan

Long term goals, many years plan that align with ORG's vision for the future. that is the high level plan that dictate the vision of Plan.

Time: Multi-years

### Organization process
- Acquisitions

Process of acquiring another the company, interest or asset

- Divestitures

how to selling the assets, interest or investment 

- Governance committees

Group manage the security governance

### Due Care and Due diligence
- Due care is the process of taking the sufficient/appropriate action and preventative measurement that avoid the security incident
- Due diligence is process of investigating the common vuln and security ricks, for having the responsibility of avoid that risk or vuln will be exploited.

## IV. Security Policies, procedure, standard, and guidelines
Policies, Standards, Procedures, Guidelines, Baselines
### Polices
- High level applied: applies to the ORG as whole 
- General scope: general, broad and non-specific
- Breaking down into 3 main types
>1. Regulatory
>
> that is a security policy, that help ORG comply with legal or industry standard
>
> 2. Advisory 
>
> that is security policy that advises on desired behavior
>
> 3. Informative
>
> Provides research and relevant information that support overall security policy
### Standards
- Scope/Mid-level: Applies to controls, technologies and assets
- Uniform: same implementation of controls, technologies, and assets
- tactical: Instructions for achieving the goals set by policies.
### Procedures
- Low-level: applies to specific tasks performed by worker
- Updated: frequently, revised and updated very often whenever new hardware or new technologies is acquired
- Detailed: Step-by-step instructions on implementations of controls
### Different between Guidelines and baselines
- Guidelines
  > Operational guidelines
  >
  > Describe how to deploy the system
  >
  > Optional, not recommended 

- Baselines
  > that is minimum level
  > 
  > All hardware, software and technologies must must meet the baselines
  >
  > May be a standard set forth by an external entity like NIST
  > All equipments or system must meet the baselines instead of remove from the production.

## V. Business Continuity
Business continuity definition, BCP-planning, 5 phases of BCP: scoping and planning, impact assessment, continuity planning, Approval and implementation, Documentation.
### Business continuity 
Defined in NIST SP 800-34: The documentation of predetermined set of instructions or procedures that describe how an ORG's mission/business process will be sustained during and after an significant disruption.
### BCP
Scope and planning, business impact assessment, Contiuity planning, Approval and implementation.
#### Scope and planning
Needed resources, team selection, legal consideration, and analysis the overall effort of returning business to operational state.
- Analysis of business: must identify critical services, people that necessary to the operation of business
- Team: select team member diverse but focus on core services. BCP team selected as bellow
> Management
>
> prioritizes the tasks, assign people to tasks, allocate resources.
>
> Legal
>
> considers regulatory, considers contractual obligation 
>
> IT specialist
>
> the person who will handles tasks that manager assign above and provide technical expertise
>
> Core Departments
>
> Provide feedback to BCP; and know how the department work; and what department need; as well as understanding how BCP task affect to their department 
- Resources: determine which resources need during development, testing, and implementation phase
#### Business impact assessment (BIA)
Consisting of some actions of analysis resources or damages, disruption that effect to the business operation. and it breakdown 4 step:
> Data gathering: collection information form individual by interview, questionnaire or any methods
> 
> Identify: identify critical business operation, resources and threats, vulnerabilities.
>
> Risk analysis: we narrow down form above step, to perform any action related to qualitative, quantitive risk analysis of impact to business operation.
>
> Documentation: any recommendation and data gather then making the report to BCP team, and senior management.

- Maximum tolerable downtime (MTD): maximum of time that business operation or functional can be inoperable or nonfunctional before reach un-recoverable state of ORG
- type of levels: critical (less than 24 hrs), urgent (24 hrs), important (72 hrs), normal (1 week), no-essential (1 month)

#### Continuity planning
That is development of strategy and determining provision planning for handover the operational state.

- Strategy: BCP team develops a strategy for implementing BCP task
- Provision: the infrastructure, resource, site all things need in place to perform BCP

#### Approval and implementation
Leadership endorsement and approval needed for the implementation of the BCP
- Approval: the highest level of leadership must provide the approval of BCP
- Implement: developing the implementation schedule, ongoing maintenance and training BCP

### Document
Consisting of six goals:
- Goals: the goals and measurement of success for the BCP
- Statements: includes some statement of importance, priorities, responsibilities, and urgency
- Risk: include the quantitative, qualitative of risk to the business and when it be mitigated
- Vital records: some important information related to business operation
- Emergency: that is emergency response guideline include who to contact, and when
- Maintenance and testing: BCP should be updated periodically, including document testing procedures

## VI. Risk management concepts
some of terminology, threats and attacks, vulnerability and exposure, security countermeasures, qualitative analysis, quantitative analysis, different ways dealing with risk.
### Risk terminology
- Threat: somethings potential or undesirable incident that adversely affected to system or assets
- Vulnerability: the weakness in a system or assets
- Exploitation: the action or process that leverage weakness of system to exploit
- Risk: similar with threat

### Threats
having 4 types threat
- Accidental: damaged caused by the unintentional action and typically the result of errors.
- Cascading: Additional and unintentional damaged cause by threat.
- Actors: terrorist, nation-state, insider threat, script kiddies.
- Natural disasters: tornadoes, avalanches, hurricanes, floods...
### Attacks
having 2 types attacks:
- Social engineering: for example "email fishing", it consisting of manipulation, deception, intimidation, and the target is human.
- Technical attack: using technical way or method to system target.
### Vulnerability and exposure
it involves to:
- NVD: national vulnerability database is repository of vuln, managed by NIST
- CVE: common vulnerability and exposures, that defines the disclosure security vuln, managed by MITRE
### Security countermeasures
Any physical, logical, technical, administrative controls used to reduce or eliminate the risk of threat being realized.

### Understanding the difference between Qualitative and quantitative risk analysis
- Qualitative focuses on the quality and intangible effects associated with risk
- Quantitative focuses on the measurable formulas and financial information.
#### Qualitative
is necessary way to measure that confidence level
- 
#### Quantitative
- Asset value (Av): the monetary of given asset 
- Exposure factor (EF): the potential amount of loss (represent as percentage) an asset will experience from a realized threat
- Single Loss Expectancy (SLE): the monetary amount associate with a single, realized threat.
- Annual Rate of Occurrence (ARO): the chance of realize threat occurring within a year.
- Annual Loss Expectancy ( ALE): expected monetary loss for the year
- Annual cost of safeguard (ACS): the cost of implementing security safeguard or control.

> formulas
>
> AS = $ (Represent by dollar amount)
>
> EF = %  (Represented as a percentage)
>
> SLE = AS *EF
>
> ARO = #/year (Number of occurrences per year)
>
> ALE = SLE * ARO = AV * EF * ARO
>
> ACS = $/year (dollar amount spent in a year)
>
> Risk = Threat * vulnerability
>
> Residual risk = Risk - control gap 
>
> Value of countermeasure = Pre countermeasure ALE - Post countermeasure ALE
>
> Control cost < Asset value

### Deal with risk
we have 6 types of risks: 
- Mitigation risk: the process of lowering or mitigating the level affectiveness of risk
- Avoidance risk: also process or action to void engaging in activity maybe present the risk
- Transfer risk: the action transferring the risk to another entity such as an insurance provider
- Rejection risk: rejecting existing or particular risk, this type related to legal liable
- Acceptance risk: Accepting the risk, particularly when the cost less than the cost of applying security safeguard 
- Residual risk: the risk left over after security countermeasures have been applied
 
## VII. Risk frameworks
Nist Risk management framework SP 800-37; some of frameworks: OCTAVE, FAIR, TARA; Threat Modeling; Threat Models;
### NIST RMF - 800-37
SP 800-37 (Risk Management Framework) includes activities to prepare the ORG to execute framework at appropriate risk management levels. The RMF also promotes near real-time risk management and ongoing system information and common control authorization through implementing the monitoring processes; provide senior leader and executive with necessary information to make efficient, cost effective, risk management decision about the systems, supporting their mission and business functions; and incorporate with security and privacy system into dev life cycle.
#### Prepare
Establish context and priorities for the risk, security and privacy management system 
#### Category
label system that process, store, transmit information based on loss impact of asset.
#### Select
Choose initial security control or privacy control to reduce risk to an acceptable level.
#### Implement
Implementing security control after select as previous step.
#### Assess
Check that security control are implemented correctly and effectively.
#### Authorize
Have senior management official determine if security, risk level and privacy meet an acceptable level.
#### Monitoring
Watch security controls and assets.

> Assessing: to see assessing control effectiveness 
> 
> Performing: risk and impact assessments
>
> Documenting changes: documenting the system changes as different configuration changes can have impact to system 
>
> Reporting: Report on security and privacy posture of systems.
