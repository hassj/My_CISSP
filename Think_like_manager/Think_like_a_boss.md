# HOW TO THINK LIKE A MANAGER
![Thinking path like boss](https://github.com/hassj/My_CISSP/blob/main/Think_like_manager/Image/Think_boss.JPG "think like a boss")
## Why

1. Asking "why" for yourself enough time than the other question with how, what, when, who, where, etc. You will have the question of high level overview
2. you need to think like a manager because you need to have high level interconnected understanding rather than focus on issue between the square box.

## Primary concept
### remember primary concept in order
![Primary concepts](https://github.com/hassj/My_CISSP/blob/main/Think_like_manager/Image/Think3.JPG "Primary concepts in order")

 1. Human safety is the top of the priority! (protect society)

  The human life is 1st priority

 2. Behave ethically (law or Boss)

 sometimes you mush choose between the ethical or organization, that is a doubt, so with the knowledge of manger you should refer
 to the (isc)2 code of ethics Or just do it by the moral sense.

 3. Business continuity (business will not fail)

 do not let the business fail. following the BCP/DRP plan

 Cash rules everything around me - no business no security, no security no job, so we must save, not waste the money for business.

 5. Avoid and minimized threats
