# SECURITY AND RISK MANAGEMENT
## CIA triad

1. What is CIA TRIAD?

- Confidentiality

Preserving authorized restriction on information access and disclosure.

Protecting personal privacy and proprietary information.

Encryption - At Transit TLS - At Rest AES -256.  

- Integrity

Guarding against improper information modification and destruction information and includes non-repudiation and authenticity.

- Availability

Ensuring timely and reliable access to and use the information by authorized user.

> Note: The action aid for CIA triad is D.A.D (Disclosure; Alternation; Destruction)

2. Achieving CIA - Best Practice

(Six principles need remember)

- Separation of duties
- Mandatory vacation
- Least Privileges
- M and N control (minimum of number people to handles sensitive role tasks)
- 2 people control (require 2 people approve each other's completed assignment)
- Rotation duties

3. Availability measuring metric

RTO: recovery time objective

RPO: recovery point objective

MTD: maximum tolerable downtime

MTBF: mean time between failure

SLA: sevice level agreement

4. IAAAA

- Identification: Unique user identification
- Authentication: validation the user identification 
- Authorization: verify privileges and permission for authenticated user
- Accountability: just only authorized user access and use the system accordingly
- Auditing: tools, processes, activity aid for making sure the execution of compliance

5. Plans

Planning for archieving the CIA Triad:

- Strategic plan: duration upto 5 years, ex: risk assessment
- Tactical plan: duration up to 1 year, ex: project budget, staffing etc
- Operation plan: duration few months, ex: patching computer, update AV signature, Daily network administration.

6. Protection mechanisms

- layering
- abstraction
- hiding
- encryption

7. Data classification

Entail analyzing the data which your ORG retain, determining its value, and importance then assigning it to a category.

8. Risk management

- No risk can not be completely avoided
- Risk can be minimized and controlled to avoid the impact of damages.
- Risk management is the process of: identifying, examining, measuring, mitigating, transferring risk.

9. Risk terminology

threat, exploit, risk, vulnerability, asset, threat agent

10. Risk management frameworks

> 1. Preventive (EX ISO 27001)
> 
> security policy, security cameras, security awareness training, job rotation, encryption, data classification.
> 2. Deterrent (EX ISO 27000)
> 3. Detective
> 4. Corrective
> 5. Recovery
